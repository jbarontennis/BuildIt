--setting up workspace to test--
1.clone from git and pull project.
2. build the project in xcode.
3. setup a localhost webservice (I used MAMP).
4. put my php files under MAMP->htdocs.
5. use sql file named buildit.sql to create to database structure.
6. if databse does not seem to be connecting to xcode check the port selected in the php file.
7. if you have an iphone, you can connect it. Otherwise the simulator is built in.
8. run the code.
